Detection of fake news using nlp
The widespread use of the internet has given rise to all kinds of media. This has also lead to people being updated consistently about news.
This also leads to news that could be right or wrong. This in turn causes problems among people and can cause discord.
This project aims to detect fake news using an NLP model by using features such as tokenisation and extraction of text data.
